CS 351 Project 1 
Modulo Times table. I already did this project last semester with 
Joe in cs 251, which is why I could'nt add my progress over time in my local repo. 
I'm pretty sure as the weeks go by, if we get new projects I will get a hang of git. 
I have 4 classes namely: DecimalTextVerifier which checks if the user has inputted a 
valid decimal. Then I have Main which has the JavaFX code and structure which involves 
buttons and everything. The Point on circle makes the points on circle which allows the 
project to move further. And visualization is the state necessary to initialize the visual 
state.
